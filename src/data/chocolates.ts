export const loveLetter = `If I had to explain how much I love you, I wouldn't use big words… I'd use chocolates.

You're my Dairy Milk — the comfort I reach for at the end of every hard day. You're warm, familiar, and being with you feels like coming home.

You're my Amul Dark — strong, intense, and not everyone gets your depth. But I do. And that's what makes us special.

You're my KitKat — my favorite break from the chaos of life. With you, I breathe easier, laugh louder, and live slower.

You're my Perk — a burst of surprise joy I never saw coming. You showed up and made everything brighter without even trying.

You're my Munch — effortlessly irresistible. You don't need to try. Just being you is enough to make me fall all over again.

You're my Bournville — refined, rare, and not for everyone. But you were always meant for me, and I was always meant to savor you.

You're my 5 Star — the reason I lose track of time, the reason I forget the world. When I'm with you, nothing else exists.

You're my Milkybar — pure, innocent, soft-hearted. Your love is the gentlest thing I've ever known, and I hold it like a treasure.

You're my Hershey's Kiss — every small moment with you is a gift. A glance, a smile, a whisper — each one leaves me wanting more.

You're my Snickers — you complete me. When I'm broken, you hold me together. When I'm lost, you bring me back. You make me whole.

So on this Chocolate Day, I want you to know — you are my favorite chocolate — the one I never get tired of, the one I always crave, the one I want to choose every single day. 🤎`;
